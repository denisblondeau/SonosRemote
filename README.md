  <p>
    This Swift/SwiftUI (MacOS) demo receives keypresses from a bluetooth remote connected to a Raspberry Pi server and forwards those commands, using unsupported (i.e. unofficial) Sonos API requests, to a Sonos controller (i.e. Sonos speakers).

## About the Project

This demo:

- Connects to a specific Sonos controller on the local network.
- Sends the following commands to the Sonos controller: Play/Pause, Previous Track, Next Track, Volume Up, Volume Down.
- Those commands are received from a bluetooth remote connected to a Raspberry Pi running a Socket IO server (Python application).
- Displays a MacOS menu bar application that let you play/pause the Sonos controller. The menu bar application also displays current play/pause status as well as current Sonos volume level (see MenuBarApp.jpeg).
- Subscribes to Sonos events (e.g. monitors play/pause state, volume level).

### Prerequisites

- Before building/running this application:
 - Install the latest release of the SonosAPI package: https://github.com/denisblondeau/SonosAPI
 - Install the Socket.IO-Client-Swift package: https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-swift
 - Install and run the Python keypress-server on a Raspberry Pi: https://github.com/denisblondeau/keypress-server

- In SonosModel.swift, you need to:
 - Set the callback URL. The callback URL is used by the Sonos coordinator to notify this demo of specific events.
 - Set the coodinator's name. This is the name of the Sonos Room you wish to control. You can find that name in the Sonos application.
 - Set the server URL. This is the Pi server hosting the SocketIO application that is receiving then forwarding the bluetooth remote's keypress to this application.

```bash
    private var callbackURL = URL(string: "http://192.168.0.1:1337")
    private var coordinatorName = "Living Room"
    private var serverURL = URL(string: "http://piserver.local:8080")
```

### Testing

Once you have launched this application:

    1) Use the bluetooth remote.
    2) Use the menu bar application to start/pause Sonos.
